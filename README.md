# Carb & Insulin Personal Calculator

I made this to personally code something that could track me carbs and calculate my insulin dosage. It ulitizes the math that every diabetic does on a daily basis and does it for them. 

## Features
- Enter food, carbs, carb ratio, current blood sugar and target, and correction factor.
- It calculates the required insulin and informs whether you are high blood sugar or low. 
- Saves meal in a CSV file
- Makes table of previous history or carbs and insulin dosage.

## How to run
- Will need to install streamlit and pandas to utilize. Run the app using streamlit. In terminal "streamlit run carb_counter.py" Then on the side bar include your data.
